# [KingdomCome0's](https://github.com/aravezskinteeth) Dotfiles

MacOS dotfiles (in progress). Here I'm storing all the configs of my main apps, mac preferences, and my rice to set up a clean mac install. It's inspired by [Excalith dotfiles](https://github.com/excalith/.dotfiles), [Tnicx dots](https://github.com/Tnixc/dots), with other features I found [here](https://dotfiles.github.io/tips/).
